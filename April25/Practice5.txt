There are three main constraints to discuss today. 
1. Primary Keys: Primary Keys must be unique and cannot be NULL.
2. Foreign Keys: If a there is a foreign key, it must be located in the main table.
3. Checks and Check Ins: These constraints are used to insure that value inside a table exists and is valid.
